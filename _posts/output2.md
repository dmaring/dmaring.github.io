Every generation hears it: “This technology is going to change the way we live everyday.” From the telephone to the internet, technologies promised to revolutionize our daily lives. Most of these products have a certainly delivered partway on the promise of changing our lives albeit mostly in a gradual impact. Others went by the wayside like [web tv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_TV). However the rate of change and technology evolution of the 21st century is unprecedented. Never in the history of human kind have we seen the amount and velocity of technical advances.

So, will someone 50 years from now be lamenting that our generation didn’t really know what change and innovation was? Possibly. But at this point in time sitting at the edge of the unknown it seems that a certain few technologies are going to speed up and truly take directly and indirectly affect how we live, work, and play at an alarming rate. Artificial Intelligence and its subset Machine Learning are creating analytical machines that can be trained from recognizing handwriting to beating world champion chess players. Neural Networks mimic the biological architecture of the brain and its decision making process.

So where does the Internet of Things fit in with these other monumental advancements in technology? Well, while the early definitions the Internet of Things varied widely, the general idea of what ‘IoT’ means in agreed upon in recent times. Internet of Things is really the state of multiple rapid evolutions of technology we’re familiar with today. For instance, the Internet portion of ‘IoT’ should be self evident. Since the explosion of the internet in the early 2000’s more and more devices are being connected. Internet infrastructure has expanded globally with fast reliable internet around the world. Further, the cost to access the internet has dropped significantly. Some argue that the internet now should be considered an essential human utility like water and power.

Okay, great, so everyone has the internet now. What makes this so revolutionary? Remember I told you that ‘IoT’ is really possible through the culmination and current state of multiple technologies working together? ‘IoT’ wouldn’t be possible without the steady reliability of Moore’s law to delivery a never ending march of putting more and more transistors on a chip every two years while cutting the price of the previous generation’s chip in half. What does this mean? It means the computers are becoming cheap. Very cheap. Today you can get a [single board computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer) for around $20. This gives you a fully functional computer that you can install software on, add sensors to, and connect to the internet.

Computers can be used in almost any circumstance now to collect and transmit data to more powerful computers. While I am writing this post, I have five devices in my bag and on my person that connect to the internet. However, its not the fact that they are connected to the internet that is most important point. It’s what these devices are doing: gathering and transmitting data.

Data in the 21st century has become a valuable currency. Some would say that it is the most valuable currency in our day in age. For many tech companies, gathering data is the business model that makes them so successful and nets them billions of dollars. Some of these companies are in our face. Facebook, Google, and Amazon are well known companies to even the most technology illiterate among us. We don’t pay traditional currency to use Facebook and Google. However, we most certainly are paying them every day with our private data as currency (whether we like it or not). What we like, who we’re friends with, our political viewpoints, and even down to our proper use of grammar is known by these companies. This data is valuable because horrifyingly creates a scarily accurate picture of who you are, what you may do in the future, and most importantly: what products advertisers can target to you.

Now that we have an idea of how we got to the current state of ‘IoT’ today let’s look at some of its current and future applications.

**Consumer**

Most people associate the Internet of Things to mean home automation. the concept of the smart home and its adoption have become increasingly common in the lives of everyday people. Lights, cameras, washing machines, thermostats are all controllable via the network today. The benefits of thi convenience do not stop at the ability to turn off any light in the house from the couch. Automation makes the home the truly “smart”. Devices can talk to each other or a central controller to allow your lights to come on when they sense someone in the room, for the heater to turn down when it doesn’t sense people in the house, and countless other “scenes” that increase the convenience and safety in our lives.

Our cars are becoming more and more connected as well. Electric cars like Tesla are in constant connection from the internet. It feeds data back to Tesla as well as downloads new software. This new software makes the Tesla more computer than car, with the ability to continue to add new features and capabilities with every update. The information fed back to Tesla is valuable in their quest to create a fully autonomous driving vehicle.

**Medical and Health Care**

The Internet of Things is revolutionizing the way that we research diseases and treat illnesses. The amount of data that is able to be collected through devices like smart watches, pacemakers, glucose monitors, and other specialized implants fed to Machine Learning models help identify new enlightenments that have gone previously unseen. This research is helping us better understand diseases and how to improve the lives with those that have them. Smart watches, monitors, and sensors are helping care takers better monitor the elderly and those individuals that would normally additional human attention giving those same people more independence and freedom.

**Manufacturing**

Manufacturing and production lines emphasize and obsess over efficiency. How fast can we make our product, with consistent quality, with reliability and safety. This is what makes IoT so interesting in this area.

Sensors on the machinery and placed on the manufacturing floor send constant data feedback on the start to finish process of making the product. This allows for realtime adjustments of the overall process as well as short and long term analysis of the plant’s performance.

Safety can be greatly improved with this increased visibility of all the machinery. The automated processes that run and make quick decisions on the plant floor also can assist in putting out fires, notifying emergency services, and shutting down dangerous machinery.

Now that we’ve explored some the uses and applications of IoT, lets talk in more detail about the technologies that must be used and evolve to support it.

**Security**

Security should be top of mind for all hardware and software developers. They have an obligation produce sound products that are safe for the use of consumers and businesses. Unfortunately, this has not been the case and security will likely continue to take a back seat in the product development process. What makes these devices so vulnerable to abuse? Many of these devices and sensors will be developed on a common operation system like Linux. Linux, being a world wide ubiquitous operating system, is constantly being updated and patched when vulnerabilities are found. All too often the creator or manufacturer of the devices will not take steps to make sure that the software is upgraded on these devices that could sit on the networks of critical systems or infrastructure.

Most consumer IoT devices connect to a cloud service that collects and analyzes data, controls the device, and interfaces with other devices. This communication out of the local area network to the cloud allows an attacker into your network if he/she gets or cracks your password to the cloud service. This vulnerability has been seen many times with hackers simple getting a users password to a family’s baby monitor account and then getting video and audio access right into that family’s home.

**Network**

With the explosion of IoT devices the internet has run out of Public IP address space. The architects behind the original IPv4 never imagined that we would ever need more than 4,294,967,296 IP addresses. However, we surpassed that number in the last few years calling for the need of something more robust that can handle all of these new devices. IPv6 was developed to address some of the shortcomings of IPv4 including the amount of internet addresses. IPv6 allows for approximately 3.403×10³² addresses comfortably handling this need.

Along with the addition of network IP addresses, IPv6 updates routing protocols to be more efficient and robust and security to be hardened.

**Conclusion**

The internet and evolution of computing have been monumental in laying the foundation for the Internet of Things. Adjacent technologies like Machine Learning and updates to Networking Technology have further allowed this trend to flourish and bear fruit. Only the future will tell the true impact on our lives and what technologies are propelled by ‘IoT’.
